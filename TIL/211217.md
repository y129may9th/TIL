## `terraform init`
  - 素のTerraformはプロバイダーが内部に組み込まれていないので、今回であればAWSプロバイダーのダウンロードが行われます。

- エラー
```bash
/terraform/vpc-handson # terraform init

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...

Error installing provider "aws": openpgp: signature made by unknown entity.

Terraform analyses the configuration and state and automatically downloads
plugins for the providers used. However, when attempting to download this
plugin an unexpected error occured.

This may be caused if for some reason Terraform is unable to reach the
plugin repository. The repository may be unreachable if access is blocked
by a firewall.

If automatic installation is not possible or desirable in your environment,
you may alternatively manually install plugins by downloading a suitable
distribution package and placing the plugin's executable file in the
following directory:
    terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64
```
```bash

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
